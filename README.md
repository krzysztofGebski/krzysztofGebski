# Hello, I‚Äôm Krzysztof Gebski üëã

I worked on a project for aEuropean software reseller, employing a flexible microservices approach. I utilized Java and Angular to create an efficient and user-friendly system, connecting everything through RESTful APIs. I managed data with MySQL and enabled real-time communication with Kafka. To maintain smooth operations, I used Jenkins for deployments and managed tasks ni Jira. My expertise extends to Java development, where I created solutions for pharmacies and medical clinics. Comprehensive testing played a pivotal role in ensuring the reliability of our software. In addition to my technical skils and project experience, I am highly motivated and always eager to learn, fostering my self-development
